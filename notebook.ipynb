    "## Conclusions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we used the CIA World factbook data to identify the leading and lagging territories of the world. Our analysis is based on demographic indicators like population, mortality, and fertility.\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Accounting for 46% of the world's total population, China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil are the most populated countries. The least populated world locations are majorly Islands and dependencies.<br>\n",
    ">- Due to their small land area, Macau, Monaco, Singapore, and Hong Kong are more densely populated than the rest of the world. However, when considering larger land areas, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Japan are the most densely populated countries.<br>\n",
    ">- Fertility is highest in Africa and lowest in Europe and Asia. Some African countries (Lesotho, Guinea-Bissau) and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Lithuania, Serbia) record the highest death rates. The Gulf cooperation countries of the Middle-East record the lowest death rates.<br>\n",
    ">- Population is rapidly declining in East and South-East Europe. This occurrence is due to reducing birth rates, increasing deaths, and emigration to other countries. Japan is also experiencing a population decline despite the positive forecasts for the country.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Limitation\n",
    "---\n",
    "  \n",
    "- It appears that the CIA collated this data between 2014 and 2015. As a result, our findings are limited to the period the data was published. They may not reflect the current state of the world's countries.\n",
